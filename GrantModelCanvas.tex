    % PROBLEM
    \node[bloc1] (b1) at (0*\layerwidth/10,4*\layersep) {
      Clearly state the real world problem your project will address.
      What are the top 3 elements of the problem?
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Text
      \item More text
      \end{itemize}
    };
    \node[title] at (b1.north west) {\underline{1. Problem}};

    % TARGET AUDIENCE
    \node[bloc2] (b2) at (2*\layerwidth/10,5*\layersep) {
      Who is seeking a solution to this problem?
      Who would buy into your solution by funding your grant?
      What type of colleague/expert are you selling to?
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Text
      \item More text
      \end{itemize}
    };
    \node[title] at (b2.north west) {\underline{2. Target audience}};

    % SOLUTION
    \node[bloc2] (b3) at (2*\layerwidth/10,3*\layersep) {
      State your proposed solution to the stated problem.
      What is your big idea?
      What are the top 3 features of your solution.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Text
      \item More text
      \end{itemize}
    };
    \node[title] at (b3.north west) {\underline{3. Solution}};

    % WHAT IS KNOWN?
    \node[bloc3] (b4) at (1.5*\layerwidth/10,1.5*\layersep) {
      Indicate the key knowledge and competing technology that already exists.
      What is the state of the field?
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Text
      \item More text
      \end{itemize}
    };
    \node[title] at (b4.north west) {\underline{4. What is Known?}};

    % WHAT IS UNKNOWN?
    \node[bloc3] (b5) at (6.5*\layerwidth/10,1.5*\layersep) {
      Indicate the critical knowledge/technology that is lacking, but needed to solve the stated problem.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Text
      \item More text
      \end{itemize}
    };
    \node[title] at (b5.north west) {\underline{5. What is Unknown?}};

    % VALUE PROPOSITIONS
    \node[bloc1] (b6) at (4*\layerwidth/10,4*\layersep) {
      Clearly state the value of your proposed solution.
      What is the \#1 contribution that your grant will deliver?
      How does it address the problem and critical gaps in knowledge.
      Your value proposition clearly states how the knowledge/technology your grant will create solves your target audienceâ€™s problem or improves their situation (relevancy to your target audience).
      Your value proposition must indicate specific benefits (value) and explain to a grant reviewer why they should buy into your grant and not the ones you are competing against (unique differentiation).
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Text
      \item More text

    % UNFAIR ADVANTAGE
    \node[bloc2] (b7) at (6*\layerwidth/10,5*\layersep) {
      What advantages do you have that others do not?
      This includes proven expertise in the area, preliminary findings that support your case, novel technology or resources.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Text
      \item More text
      \end{itemize}
    };

    % EXPECTED IMPACT
    \node[bloc2] (b8) at (6*\layerwidth/10,3*\layersep) {
      Clearly indicate the expected impact of your solution.
      What will the impact be?
      Which fields will be transformed?
      Why will it be transformative?
      How far reaching could the impact be on research, society and healthcare?
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Text
      \item More text
      \end{itemize}
    };
    \node[title] at (b8.north west) {\underline{8. Expected Impact}};

    % KEY RESOURCES NEEDED

      What key resources or collaborators do you need to be successful?
      Indicate them here.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Text
      \item More text
      \end{itemize}
    };
    \node[title] at (b9.north west) {\underline{9. Key Resources Needed}};

    % NOVELTY
    \node[bloc2] (b10) at (8*\layerwidth/10,3*\layersep) {
      What is the evidence that your solution is novel?
      State what is novel about your solution and do some reading to make sure you are right!
